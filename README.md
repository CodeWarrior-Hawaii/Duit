A simple todo list

The Home Controller and associated view are some UI ideas that I was turning over after completing the initial functionality.

The Tasks Controller and associated views contain base MVC functionality plus a little Jquery because I have never liked looking at essentially the details page for an entity and telling it to delete that entity.  It adds extra page loads for no good reason (at least when you can see the entire entity already).  There is one small problem that I did know of that I did not take the time to fix.  When the modal (Are you sure you wish to delete this task?) is told to hide, the modal hides, but the backdrop remains occluding the entire viewport, requiring a page reload to get rid of it.

All in all this was a nice little exercise.  I look forward to your thoughts.
